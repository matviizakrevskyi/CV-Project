# CV Project

<https://matvii-zakrevskyi.web.app/>

#### This is a web project with my resume. I decided to write it in order to try to write a web project in Flutter, as well as try Firebase hosting.

The project consists of two screens: one describes my Flutter projects, and the other contains all the other information about me.
I used the Responsive Framework library to make the project look good on different devices. The project also uses the BLoC library for state management.

### All libraries and tools used:

* BLoC
* Responsive Framework
* Url Launcher Web
